Salon player is a single-page web application that acts as an online music player. This music player application allows users to browse and play music, create playlists, and add your favorite song to favorites list.

This application consists of main section of page that displays the current content of application and two navigation bars: one at the top of page which contains search and settings for the users or register button if user has not logged in and the other one at the side of the page that contains two sections namely my music and my playlist.

Recently played displays all the recently played tracks on the main section of page whereas my favorites display all the favorite tracks that user has liked.
